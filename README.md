# Netflix-Case-Study

My very first hands on experience on working for data analysis using Pythpn Pandas.
This case study is on a sample Netflix data upon which various analysis such as popular genre, popular actor and popular director are carried out based on the number of movies or Tv shows they have produced.
Also various graphs are plotted using matplotlib and seaborn to visualise data.
Kindly have a look.
